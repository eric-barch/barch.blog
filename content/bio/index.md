I grew up in a sleepy Connecticut hamlet called Simsbury, the Platonic ideal of a New England small town. A river runs through its center, and in the fall the hills turn bright orange. Ten miles south of the Massachusetts border, its residents have a Bostonian taste for Dunkin’ coffee and Patriots football.

I dabbled in a lot of extracurriculars, but Boy Scouts had the biggest impact. At my peak, I was leaving home almost every weekend to explore a new corner of the Northeast. Together with my best friends, I spent my youth conquering regional high points and seeing whether I could survive the weekend without a sleeping bag or tent. I developed a love for the outdoors, leadership, self-sufficiency, and problem-solving.

In high school, I took up running. I was never particularly talented, but I liked the mental challenge and the camaraderie of the team. I made Captain of the Cross Country team my senior year.

In the summers, I worked as a camp counselor at a local farm. The staff was close and it was a lot of fun. After work, we’d cool off at a rope swing we hung by the river or pile into my Jeep and go off-roading.

All in all, it was a good childhood — the quintessential American boyhood. Very Huck Finn.

I was always a good student, albeit somewhat lazy with a tendency to procrastinate on things I deemed unworthy of my interest. When it was time to go to college, I chose the College of William & Mary. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but politics was one interest and W&M had a good government program. I ended up double majoring in Economics and Government to keep my options open. I studied very little but managed decent grades by cramming. I spent most of the rest of my time on my fraternity, which was a lot of fun if not terribly productive.

Graduation came and I still hadn't found my calling. I had this vague idea that I wanted to be a master of the universe, and the friends in my circle who were similarly ambitious all seemed focused on finance and law. I was too late for the finance recruiting cycle, and I had always found the idea of law school appealing, so I applied to paralegal jobs in New York City. In my mind, such a job would be a mix of finance _and_ law just by virtue of its location in the capital of capitalism. I got a job as a paralegal in the Bankruptcy, Restructuring & Reorganization group at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, a white shoe law firm in New York. So I moved there.

Living in New York was exciting and exhausting.
