I grew up in a sleepy New England hamlet called Simsbury, Connecticut. Ten miles from the Massachusetts border, it's not the Connecticut that most New Yorkers picture. People work in Hartford, not Manhattan. They root for the Red Sox, not the Yankees. There are more farms than country clubs (though we have a lot of those too).

Of the numerous extracurriculars that, like most other kids, was signed up for, sometimes of my own accord and other times more against my will, I remember Boy Scouts the most. At the height of my involvement, we were going on a trip every other weekend. We had a great Scoutmaster (adult leader of the troop) who emphasized personal accountability and leadership. The trips usually involved conquering some mountain, or going camping with no gear and seeing if we could survive the weekend using things that we made with bushcraft. It made me feel like I was a leader, like I was destined for greatness.

Another big force in my life was running. I signed up for Cross Country the fall of my freshman year of high school. I was never particularly talented at it, but I liked the camaraderie of the team and the challenge of pushing myself. I was Captain my senior year.

I was a good student. I was a National Merit Semifinalist and the President of National Honor Society.
