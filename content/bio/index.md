I grew up in a sleepy Connecticut hamlet called Simsbury, the Platonic ideal of a New England small town. A river runs through its center and its hills turn bright orange in the fall. Ten miles south of the border with Massachusetts, its nutmegger residents have a Bostonian taste for Dunkin' coffee and Patriots football.

Of the many extracurriculars I tried growing up, Boy Scouts was the most impactful. At the height of my involvement, I was leaving home every other weekend to explore a new corner of the American Northeast. Together with my best friends, I got to spend my youth conquering regional high points and disappearing into the woods for full weekends at a time. I learned a love for the outdoors, problem solving, and leadership.

In high school I took up running. I was never particularly talented at it, but I liked the mental challenge and, more importantly, the camaraderie of the team. I was Captain of the Cross Country team my senior year.

In the summers I worked at a local farm. Some days after work, we would cool off at a rope swing we had hung by the river. Other days, we would load into my Jeep and go off-roading in a local state park.

I was always a good student.

When it was time to go to college, I chose the College of William & Mary. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but I was interested in leadership (and, admittedly, prestige), so politics seemed like a possibility. William & Mary didn't end up being a great fit, but I now look back on my time there fondly. I double majored in Economics and Government. I studied very little but managed decent grades by cramming. I made some great friends.

Graduation came and I still hadn't found my calling. I had this vague idea that I wanted to be a master of the universe, and the friends in my circle who were similarly ambitious all seemed focused on finance and law. I was too late for the finance recruiting cycle, and I had always found the idea of law school appealing, so I applied to paralegal jobs in New York City. In my mind, such a job would be a mix of finance _and_ law just by virtue of its location in the capital of capitalism. I got a job as a paralegal in the Bankruptcy, Restructuring & Reorganization group at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, a white shoe law firm in New York. So I moved there.

Living in New York was exciting and exhausting.
