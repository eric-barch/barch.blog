<!--Too much "Dependent clause, independent clause" -->
I grew up in a sleepy Connecticut hamlet called Simsbury. Settled in the 1670s (that's right, it's so old that it was _settled_, not founded), it's the Platonic ideal of a New England small town. Just ten miles south of the border with Massachusetts, the nutmegger residents have adopted a Bostonian taste for Dunkin' coffee and Patriots football.

Like most kids, I tried a lot of extracurriculars growing up. Boy Scouts was the most impactful. At the height of my involvement, I was leaving home every other weekend to explore some new corner of the Northeast.

Another big force in my life was running. I signed up for Cross Country the fall of my freshman year of high school. I was never particularly talented at it, but I liked the camaraderie of the team and the challenge of pushing myself. I was Captain my senior year.

I was a good student. I was a National Merit Semifinalist and the President of National Honor Society.

When it was time to go off to university, I chose the College of William & Mary. I had grown up through the Obama era when, at least to this blue state denizen, politics still seemed like a lofty calling. With my interest in leadership (and, admittedly, prestige) a school close to DC with a good Political Science program was appealing.

It was not a great fit, but I now look back on it fondly. My main activity while I was there was my fraternity. I had fun and made some good friends, but I would not recommend focusing on one's fraternity as the primary interest during college. I double majored in Government and Economics. I studied very little but got good grades by cramming during all nighters the night before the exam and then promptly dumping all the information as soon as I turned in my exam. I made great friends while I was there.

When it was time to graduate, I didn't know what I wanted to do. I had gotten through most of college avoiding the question. I came back to this vague idea of being a politician, and I figured the first step to getting there was to go to law school. Well, there were two months until graduation and I hadn't taken the LSAT, so I started applying to paralegal jobs. I also had housing set up with a buddy in New York City if I could get a job there, so I started applying to white shoe law firms in New York. A friend I drove home somewhere had a dad who used to work at Willkie Farr & Gallagher. I think he put in a good word for me after I interviewed there.

I went and worked at Willkie. Living in the city was exciting and exhausting.
