I was raised in a sleepy Connecticut hamlet called Simsbury, the Platonic ideal of a New England small town. A river runs through its center, and the hills turn bright orange in fall. Just south of Massachusetts, its residents have a Bostonian taste for Dunkin’ coffee and Patriots football.

I dabbled in a bunch of extracurriculars growing up, but Boy Scouts had the biggest impact. At the peak, I was leaving home almost every weekend to explore some new corner of the Northeast. Together with my best friends, I spent my youth conquering regional high points and seeing whether I could survive the weekend without a sleeping bag or tent. I developed a love for the outdoors, leadership, self-sufficiency, and problem-solving.

In high school, I took up running. I wasn't particularly talented, but I liked the mental challenge and the camaraderie of the team. I made Cross Country Captain my senior year.

During the summers, I worked as a camp counselor at a local farm. The staff was close and we had a lot of fun. After work, we’d cool off at a rope swing we hung by the river or pile into my Jeep to go off-roading.

It was a good childhood — the quintessential American boyhood. Very Huck Finn.

I was always a good student, very driven but with a tendency to procrastinate on things I found uninteresting. When it was time to go to college, I chose the College of William & Mary. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but politics was one interest and W&M had a good government program. I ended up double majoring in Economics and Government to keep my options open. I studied very little, but managed decent grades by cramming. The rest of my time was spent mostly on my fraternity, which was fun if not terribly productive.

Graduation came and I was still searching for my calling. I was fiercely ambitious, but my energy was unfocused because I lacked a clear definition of success. Ever prone to defining it as winning out over others, I looked around to see what my smartest peers were doing. Everyone in my mostly-Greek, liberal-arts-educated circle seemed to be pursuing finance or law. I was too late for the finance recruiting cycle, so I applied to paralegal openings with the idea that it would be a stepping stone to law school. I landed a job at the white shoe law firm [Willkie Farr & Gallagher](https://www.willkie.com/) and moved to New York City.

New York was exciting and exhausting. My hours were unpredictable. A slow day was often upended by an end-of-day fire drill and I'd have to stay at the office into the wee hours of the morning. It became apparent that a career as a corporate lawyer wasn’t the path to success I’d envisioned. I didn’t mind the intensity and hard work, but even the partners — the ones who had “made it” — had no control over their time. I knew I didn't want to be a wage worker forever, and lawyers definitionally bill by the hour. You're stuck trading your time for money at a fixed rate even at the highest echelons of the profession.

I had been at Willkie for a little under a year when a recruiter reached out about a role at [Apollo](https://apollo.com).

Tired of writing. To be continued...
